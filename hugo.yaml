    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/group_portrait_compressed.jpg"
    content: |-
      I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems. I bring three years of dense experience as a Process Engineer and Program Manager at a leading semiconductor manufacturing company, where I specialized in process optimization and cross-functional project management. I have a strong interest in challenging conventional thinking and pushing the boundaries of what’s considered impossible. Currently, I am pursuing a Post-Degree Diploma in Data Analytics at [Langara College](https://langara.ca/programs-courses/data-analytics-post-degree-diploma) in Vancouver, BC..

      I am also working on an applied research project focused on cancer detection, aiming to contribute to early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.
